This plug-in should be put into the `plugin` directory of your OpenRCT2 folder. After that, the features will become available under the Map button. 

Current features:
- Set Colours for all Stalls
- Toggle the "Use Random Colour" Flag for all Stalls.


This plugin and readme is deeply inspired by other peoples existing plugins. This couldn't exist without them, so thank you, Gymnasiast and others.
